\subsection{Linear Subspaces}

We begin by proving a result from elementary linear algebra.

\begin{theorem}
	Let $W_1$ and $W_2$ be vector spaces. Then $\dim W_1 + W_2 = \dim W_1 + \dim W_2 - \dim W_1 \cap W_2$ 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Let $S = \{ u_1 \cdots u_r \}$ be the basis of $W_1 + W_2$. Let $B_1 = \{ u_1 \cdots u_r v_1 \cdots v_s \}$ and $B_2 = \{ u_1 \cdots u_r w_1 \cdots w_t \}$ be $B$ extended to be the basis of $W_1$ and $W_2$ respectively. 
	If we can show $B$ is the basis of $W_1 + W_2$, we have our result, as $\dim B = r + s + t = (r + s) + (r + t) - r = \dim W_1 + \dim W_2 - \dim W_1 \cap W_2.$

	First, we show $B$ is linearly independent. Let 

	\[\sum_i^r{a_iu_i} + \sum_j^s{b_jv_j} + \sum_k^t{c_kw_k} = 0\]. 

	Notice if we move terms so 

	\[\sum_i^r{a_iu_i} + \sum_j^s{b_jv_j} = -\sum_k^t{c_kw_k}\], 

	then the LHS is in $W_1$ and the RHS is in $W_2$, so both sides represent the same element in $W_1 + W_2$. 

	Then $\sum_i^r{d_iu_i} = -\sum_k^t{c_kw_k}$, where the LHS uses $B$ and the RHS uses $B_2$. Again moving terms:

	\[\sum_i^r{d_iu_i} + \sum_k^t{c_kw_k} = 0\]

	Where all $c_i$ must be 0 as $B_2$ is linearly independent. Then

	\[\sum_i^r{a_iu_i} + \sum_j^s{b_jv_j} = 0\]

	But the LHS is described by $B_1$ which is also linearly independent so all $a_i$, $b_j$ must also be 0. Then $B$ is linearly independent.

	Consider any $w_1 + w_2$. 

	\[w_1 = \sum_i^r{a_iu_i} + \sum_j^s{b_jv_j}\]
	\[w_2 = \sum_i^r{d_iu_i} + \sum_k^t{c_kw_k}\]

	Then

	\[w_1 + w_2 = \sum_i^r{(a_i + d_i) u_i} + \sum_j^s{b_jv_j} + \sum_k^t{c_kw_k} \in \operatorname{span} W_1 + W_2 \]

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	In a projective plane $P(V)$, two projective lines, $P(U)$ and $P(U')$, intersect in a unique point.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	From elementary linear algebra, $\dim V \geq \dim U + U'$. We have shown that $\dim U + U' = \dim U + \dim U' - \dim {U \cap U'}$.
	Then $1 \leq \dim {U \cap U'} \leq 2$. Because $P(U)$ and $P(U')$ are distinct, $\dim {U \cap U'} = 1$. So $P(U \cap U')$ is a projective point.
\end{proof}
