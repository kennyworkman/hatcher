## connected + path connected review

* Recall the proof that `[a, b]` is connected for any a, b in R
* The continuous maps we are able to construct for a path connected space (f: [0, 1] \to X) are only significant because `[0, 1]` itself is connected
* Convince yourself that any path connected space must be connected (by contradiction)
